2. You choose between sort the pictures in this folder or somewhere else. Select yes if you want to stay in this folder.
3. You respond "y" if you want to put your sorting in a subfolder. If you said yes you should choose the name of the subfolder

5. When you're done, only the JPG you want to keep are remaining in you're folder, you can type "y" in the console, and the script will automatically delete all RAWs corresponding to the deleted JPGs. 

## Why this project ?

As an amateur photographer, I usually shoot in RAW+JPG. When I comeback to my house to sort ans select good pictures to edit, I come to a point very frustating : the management of RAWs pictures by Windows. The easiest way was to sort the JPGs pictures and then work on the corresponding RAWs. I came across with the idea of a simple little python script (my only known language at this time) to make the hard work. The idea was just to delete all garbage pictures, only by knowing the ones I like.
